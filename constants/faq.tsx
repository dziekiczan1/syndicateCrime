    question: "How can I increase my energy?",
    answer:
      "To increase your energy stat, there are a couple of methods you can employ. Natural Restoration: Your energy is naturally restored over time. Typically, you regain 1 point of energy every 15 minutes of gameplay. This means that if you're patient and allow time to pass, your energy will gradually replenish itself.

However, be mindful that these drugs may come with associated costs or potential side effects.",
